#' Kolodziejczk et al. 2015: Simulation Result
#'
#' 869 mouse embryonic stem cells under three different conditions (cnts data object):
#' serum + LIF (242 cells), 2i + LIF (433 cells) and alternative 2i + LIF (194 cells).
#' Single cell RNA-Seq was performed using Fluidigm C1 system and
#' libraries were generated using Nextera XT (Illumina) kit.
#' We reduced the data set to standard serum + LIF cultured cells for
#' parameter estimation. For the simulation 20% of 10000 simulated genes were differentially expressed with a broad symmetrical gamma distribution of log2 fold changes. For DE testing, limma trend was used.
